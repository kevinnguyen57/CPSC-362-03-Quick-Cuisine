# CPSC-362-03-Quick-Cuisine
Project for Software Engineering

## Project Description
Quick Cuisine will be a Web Application that can be used by anyone who is looking for a recipe with limited ingredients. 
Users will be able to quickly find multiple recipes that may satisfy their hunger with whatever they have in their fridge and/or cabinets.

In other words, people who have limited ingredients in their home and have troruble creating a recipe with what they already have can use this website for recipes. This way, people would not have to go grocery shopping or eat out at restuarants, especially when saving money and/or not having time to go to the market.
